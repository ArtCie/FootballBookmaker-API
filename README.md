# FootballBookmaker-API
Based on AWS EB(Python Flask Web application) + Football API + PostgreSQL DB
EB web server uses cron to update database each 24 hours(update results + players, coaches, teams) and generates new set of predictions for upcoming EPL round

# Important!
This code won't work anymore since EB environment was shut down due to costs that it might generate - project was created for a OOP classes on Politechnika Krakowska
